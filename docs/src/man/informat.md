# Informats

The `DLMReader` package uses `informat` to call a special type of functions on raw text before parsing its values. This gives a flexible feature to `DLMReader` and enables it to handle messy delimited files.

The package is shipped with some pre-registered `informat`s which are listed (new informats may be added to future releases) below:

* `STRIP!`: Remove leading and trailing blanks
* `COMMA!`: Remove `$`, and `,`(thousands separators) from the numbers
* `COMMAX!`: Treat `,` as decimal point, and removes `â‚¬`, and `.` (thousands separators) from numbers
* `NA!`: Treat `NA`, `na`, `Na`, `nA` as missing
* `BOOL!`: Convert any form of `True` and `False` to `1` and `0`, respectively
* `ACC!`: Treat numbers in parentheses (Accounting format) as negative values, i.e. it replaces `(` with `-` and `)` with blank.
* `COMPRESS!`: Remove all blanks (`0x20`)

Users can define their own informats, which is basically a function with one positional argument. The function must accept a special mutable string and returns its modified value (or returns a subset of it). To use the new defined function as `informat`, user must register it by calling the `register_informat` function.

> Note that if the function definition is changed, `DLMReader` uses the new definition and user MUST re-register it to avoid extra allocation.

## Supported string manipulation functions

The function used for informat must accept a special mutable string type and return it. Thus, user must only modify the input argument in-place. Currently, few string manipulation functions are optimised for this purpose - For small to medium size files, user can use any other functions, which support working with `AbstractString`, for manipulating the input argument: (in the following paragraph `x` is referring to the positional argument of the user defined informat)

* **isequal**: User can use `isequal` to check if the input function or a sub-string of it is equal to a string.
* **setindex!**: To assign a string to the input argument, use `setindex!(x, "newtext")` syntax. If the length of new text is smaller than `x`, it will be padded with blank (`0x20`), if it is longer than `x` it will be truncated.
* **replace!**: User can use `replace!` to replace part of the input argument. For instance `replace!(x, "12"=>"21")` replace every occurrence of "`12`" with "`21`". Note that shorter replacing text will be padded with blank and longer ones will be truncated.
* **occursin**: `occursin("text", x)` determines whether the first argument is a substring of the second.
    * User can use regular expressions too, i.e. `occursin(r::Regex, x)`
* **contains**: `contains(x, "text")` determines whether the second argument is a substring of the first.
    * User can use regular expressions too, i.e. `contains(x, r::Regex)`
* **findfirst**: User can search for the first occurrence of the index of a regular expression pattern via the allocation free function `findfirst`, i.e. `findfirst(r::Regex, x)`
* **findnext**: User can search for the next occurrence of the index of a regular expression pattern vai the allocation free function `findnext`, i.e. `findnext(r::Regex, x, i)`
* **remove!**: It removes some text (replace it with blanks) from the input argument. It can removes a `String` constant or a sequence of string location provided as a range, e.g.
    * `remove!(x, "text")`
    * `remove!(x, 2:4)`

> Users can test the new defined informats by calling `DLMReader.test(f, text)` where `f` is the user defined informat and `text` is a given string.
